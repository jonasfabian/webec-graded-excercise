Kanban Board

### Description

TODO: Write around a 5 sentence description of your idea and the entities you intend to create.

We want to create an app, where the users could create a board for their project that reflects the tasks they have to do to complete it.
The tasks can be moved between different Progress steps. 
Optionally the tasks can be categorised into different groups to group related tasks.
Tasks are created in the backlog and can be moved to the board to start the development of the task
